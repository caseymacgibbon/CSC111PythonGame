a "user persona", including a short description of a hypothetical person for whom the project is being designed including their relationship to technology, and their motivation (why do they want to interact with your project?)
a diagram that describes individual components of the project and their interaction (include an indication of which pieces are complete, in progress, and not yet started)

# user persona: 
the project is designed for people who wants to do small memorizing game with fun pictures and description. The game is designed for people of all ages who want to practice memorization. The game is not supposed to be too challenging. Only for fun!!


# What we have finished in the flow chart:
  - making separate functions for each type of pie
  - establishing a recipe
  - our logic works except we have to substitute it into pictures
  - wrongIngredient() (the outcome if the user puts wrong ingredients)
  - timer module use
  - things that need to be substituted into pictures (Hope we can figure this out after this week)
  - ingredient pics too
  - figure out how to resize images (esp background)
  - find if we can move ingredients into a specific spot using up, down, left, right keys
  - Add choices of ingredient groups for apple and pumpkin
  - change time back
# What is in progress in the flow chart:
  - we are done!
# What we haven't started in the flow chart:
  - we are done!

# How the project should be graded
We effectively used classes and functions to create a game that is entirely played in the window. We used the graphics skills that we learned in class and applied them to make the ingredients draw, move, and undraw to make a game.
